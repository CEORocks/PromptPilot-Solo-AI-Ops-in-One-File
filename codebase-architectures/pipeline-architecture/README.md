# Pipeline (Sequential Flow) Architecture

This directory demonstrates a Pipeline Architecture implementation with a simple data processing application.

## Structure

```
pipeline-architecture/
├── pipeline/
│   ├── input_stage.py           # Input parsing and preparation
│   ├── processing_stage.py      # Core computation or transformation
│   ├── output_stage.py          # Final formatting or response handling
│   └── pipeline_manager.py      # Coordinates stage execution
└── shared/
    └── utilities.py             # Common utilities across pipeline
```

## Benefits

- Clearly defined linear execution simplifies reasoning and debugging
- Easy to scale or optimize individual pipeline stages independently
- Facilitates predictable context management

## Cons

- Rigid linearity limits branching and complex decision-making scenarios
- Major workflow changes can require extensive pipeline refactoring

## Running the Example

```bash
uv run main.py
```

This example demonstrates a data processing pipeline that:
1. Reads and validates input data
2. Processes and transforms the data
3. Formats and outputs the results
