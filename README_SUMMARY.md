# Single File Agents (SFA) - Summary

Single File Agents (SFA) is a collection of powerful, self-contained AI agents, each designed to perform a specific task within a single Python file. The project explores efficient patterns for building AI agents that can scale in capability as compute power and intelligence increase.

## Key Points

- Built on top of [uv](https://github.com/astral/uv), a modern Python package installer and resolver
- Focused on creating compact, specialized AI agents for specific tasks
- Each agent is entirely self-contained in a single Python file for easy distribution and modification
- Implementations across different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini)
- Demonstrates practical examples for data processing, database querying, and text generation
- Featured on the [IndyDevDan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@indydevdan)
- Shows how tools like [Devin](https://devin.ai/), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Aider](https://aider.chat/) can be used with principled AI coding patterns

This repository serves as both a practical toolkit and a demonstration of effective prompt engineering and GenAI patterns for real-world applications.
